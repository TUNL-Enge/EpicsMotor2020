This directory is used for code and instructions to control Parker LV2 stepper motor with Acs MCB4B motor control board.

'MyMotor' is my final version Epics IOC.

'MotorSim' is the Qt project folder for motor control GUI. And there is a build folder.

'assemble_synApps.sh' is used to assemble synApps. It will report an error but all the modules we need will have been assembled before then. I used this script because the zipped synApps file that I downloaded from official website had a fatal compilation error.
