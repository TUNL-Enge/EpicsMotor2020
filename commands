Motor IOC set up notes  --Kaixin Song, 2021 summer

# check usb connection:

lsusb

# you should see a device like Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port. That's the usb to RS232 cable.

# give permission to usb, might be helpful:

crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 5 apr 23.01 ttyUSB0
sudo usermod -a -G dialout enge # enge is replaced by your username
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0

#then log out and sign in again  
#It may not be USB0, depending on which USB port you plugged it in. type:

dmesg

# to check.

untick 'shadow build' to apply changes to ui

fix $(Motor) path in .substitution file

In epics after iocInit(): type

asynReport 10

to show if it is connected.


For my IOC, after compilation and running st.cmd, it reports a bug(scroll up to see it). 
To resolve that, in MyMotor.dbd (your_IOC_name.dbd)in your IOC folder, delete these buggy lines :

recordtype(scalcout) {
}
device(scalcout, INST_IO, devscalcoutStream, "stream")

Do this everytime you 'make rebuild' your IOC App. The line number changes but is displayed when you run it.

I did the following when I messed up with a board with a physically bad swiching while I didn't realize the problem. Hope that you don't have to do it:

change to 'int autoPower = 1' in asynMotorController.cpp (I changed two files with the same name in synApp/support/motor-X-X)

add the following:
  setIntegerParam(pC_->motorPowerAutoOnOff_, 1);
  setDoubleParam(pC_->motorPowerOnDelay_, 0.0);
  setDoubleParam(pC_->motorPowerOffDelay_, 0.0);
in MCB4BDriver.cpp: asynStatus MCB4BAxis::poll(bool *moving), at the beginning

add #include "asynMotorController.h" to (MyMotor)Main.cpp
